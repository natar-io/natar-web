            Here you can load calibration files to your system.
            All the calibrations displayed here are stored on your hard drive.
            You can find them in 
            %tt /usr/share/natar-webserver/data/calibration/
            Â . Some are dedicated to your device, such as the camera calibration, while
            others are default configurations.

            A special kind of file are the markerboards. They represent the printed sheets
            of paper that can be tracked by the system. They are loaded inside the <tt>markerboard</tt> key
            as a list, then in
            %tt markerboards:[name]:xml
            to be used by the system.

              This is for advanced uses and restoration. You could break the correct function of your device if you load
              invalid calibration to specific keys.
